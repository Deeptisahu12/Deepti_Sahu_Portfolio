# üëã Welcome! I'm Deepti Sahu ‚Äî A Data Analyst turning raw data into actionable insights.

**üéØ Data Analyst | Excel ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ Dashboards ‚Ä¢ ETL ‚Ä¢ Feature Engineering**

üöÄ I'm continuously learning and working on real-world data problems. Open to collaboration, freelance projects, and full-time opportunities in data analytics!

I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive data-informed decisions. With a solid foundation in **Excel** and **SQL**, I efficiently extract, clean, and analyze structured datasets to uncover valuable business intelligence.

Leveraging **Python** and its robust ecosystem ‚Äî including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Dask** (for large-scale data) ‚Äî I perform advanced data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing. My experience also includes **feature engineering**, **ETL processes**, and building reproducible workflows for analytics pipelines.

I apply **machine learning** techniques using **Scikit-learn** to build predictive models, and I develop dynamic, insight-driven dashboards to communicate data stories clearly and effectively. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with data and continuously improving my skills across the analytics stack.
