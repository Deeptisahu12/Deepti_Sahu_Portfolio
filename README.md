# 👋 Hi, I'm Deepti Sahu 

**🎯 Data Analyst | Excel • SQL • Python • Dashboards • ETL • Feature Engineering**

I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive data-informed decisions. With a solid foundation in **Excel** and **SQL**, I efficiently extract, clean, and analyze structured datasets to uncover valuable business intelligence.

Leveraging **Python** and its robust ecosystem — including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Dask** (for large-scale data) — I perform advanced data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing. My experience also includes **feature engineering**, **ETL processes**, and building reproducible workflows for analytics pipelines.

I apply **machine learning** techniques using **Scikit-learn** to build predictive models, and I develop dynamic, insight-driven dashboards to communicate data stories clearly and effectively. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with data and continuously improving my skills across the analytics stack.

## 💼 My Tools
